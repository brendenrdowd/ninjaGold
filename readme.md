# Ninja Gold
Ninja Gold is a very simple RPG game built using MEAN where users can choose where to "go" to earn some gold.

The master branch is a working but simplistic version of the application, really only using Angular, not express and mongo. 

## In Development
In the development branch I am working on adding a user log in/registration so users can pick up where they left off. I'm also modularizing the html instead of being a single component application, taking advantage of the component structure to redistribute the load. 

I am also planning to spice up the activity log a little bit to make it a little more interesting using random anecdotes.
